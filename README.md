Generate *.vot files for Aladin software (sky map software - aladin.u-strasbg.fr)

*.vot files describe the field of view (fov) of a camera behind a telescope.
You can load these files in Aladin to show the fov on the sky map.

The purpose of this class is to simplify the creation of *.vot files when you have multiple cameras and telescopes (cartesian product).
